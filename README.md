**Project Overview**

This project explores New York City Citi Bike usage using Microsoft Excel. The analysis focuses on understanding how riders use the Citi Bike system through trends in time, location, user type, and demographics. All work including cleaning, pivot tables, and visualizations was completed using Excel.

**Objectives**

This project answers the following key questions:

What is the busiest day of the week for Citi Bike usage?

What are the top 20 pickup locations?

How does trip duration vary by age group?

How does bike rental frequency vary across age groups?

How do user types (One-Time vs Subscriber) behave across weekdays?

**Tools Used**

*Microsoft Excel

*Pivot Tables

*Pivot Charts

*Data Cleaning Tools (filters, split columns, remove duplicates)

*Excel functions

*Conditional Formatting

*Slicers

**Analysis Performed**

**Busiest Day of the Week**

Using pivot tables, daily trip counts were calculated to determine which weekday had the highest Citi Bike usage.

**Top 20 Pickup Locations**

Trips were grouped by start station to identify the 20 most frequent pickup locations across the dataset.

**Trip Duration by Age Group**

Riders were assigned to age groups based on birth year, and average/median trip duration was calculated for each group.

**Bike Rentals by Age Group**

The number of total trips taken by each age group was summarized to understand which groups ride the most.

**User Type (One-Time vs Subscriber) by Weekday**

 What User type (Subscriber vs One-Time/Customer) is busiest on which day of the week to compare usage patterns between casual riders and frequent users.

**Visualizations**

*The Excel file contains charts and tables for:

*Day-of-week trip volume

*Top 20 pickup stations

*Trip duration distributions

*Rentals by age group

*User type usage across weekdays

**Summary of Findings**

The busiest day of the week was _Wednesday_

The most popular pickup location was _Grove St PATH_

_Younger_ riders tend to take _shorter_ trips compared to _older_ riders

The _35-44 age group_ had the highest number of rentals

_Subscribers_ ride more consistently throughout the week but with most being on _weekdays_, while _One-Time_ users show more use on _weekends_
